<h2>A basic HTML table</h2>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Introduction</th>
    <th>Hobbies</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tanh Tran</td>
    <td>Greetings. I am Tanh Tran but you can call me by my nickname, which is Sunny</td>
    <td>I like streaming on Twitch and editing videos for Youtube. I enjoy playing video games.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To understand the example better, we have added borders to the table.</p>
